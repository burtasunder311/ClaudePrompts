# Tool: TaskCreate

Source: `src/tools/TaskCreateTool/prompt.ts`

## Description

```
Use this tool to create a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
```

## When to Use

Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

- **Complex multi-step tasks** — When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
- **Non-trivial and complex tasks** — Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
- **Plan mode** — When using plan mode, create a task list to track the work
- **User explicitly requests todo list** — When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
- **User provides multiple tasks** — When users provide a list of things to be done
- **After receiving new instructions** — Immediately capture user requirements as tasks
- **When you start working on a task** — Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work
- **After completing a task** — Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks

## When NOT to Use

Skip using this tool when:
- There is only a single, straightforward task
- The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
- The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
- The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE: You should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Task Fields

- **subject**: A brief, actionable title in imperative form (e.g., "Fix authentication bug in login flow")
- **description**: What needs to be done
- **activeForm** (optional): Present continuous form shown in the spinner when in_progress (e.g., "Fixing authentication bug"). If omitted, the spinner shows the subject instead.

All tasks are created with status `pending`.

## Tips

- Create tasks with clear, specific subjects that describe the outcome
- After creating tasks, use TaskUpdate to set up dependencies (blocks/blockedBy) if needed
- Check TaskList first to avoid creating duplicate tasks
